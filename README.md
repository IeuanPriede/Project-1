## Design

### Colour Scheme

I wanted to use a darker red colour scheme to add emphasis to fact that this site is about the Roman Empire. A darker shade of red, or maroon, is synonymous to the Romans.

* In the header and footer I used the colour of maroon.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* For the Page Title I have used the google font [Cormorant] ('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cormorant:ital,wght@0,300..700;1,300..700&display=swap')
* For the Page Content I have used the google font [Karla] ('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Karla:ital,wght@0,200..800;1,200..800&display=swap')

### Imagery

As the website is called The Roman Empire, I wanted to use an image for the page background of a Roman structure (colosseum ) to give the user the feeling that they are visiting an ancient Roman site.
